## Things that need to get done.
##

1. Update the comments_count field on all the feed items.
2. Update the items count all all the comments. (Possibly write a job to do this automatically.)

4. Draw a picture for the how it works sections.  (News outlets -> TPF -> Consumers)
5. Add hide category functionality
6. Make top category list only take into account the past couple of days.
7. Create an easier way to merge categories.
8. Add stats to the view article section so that everyone can see why an article ranked the way it did
9  Add bonus points for news articles that have textual descriptions.
10. Make only wwww. work.
11. Make the feed image parsing work.
12. Fix the rating thing so that we only analyze feeds items that are less than 20 days old.
13. Increase the width of the google banner
