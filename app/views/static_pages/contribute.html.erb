		<h3><a name="user">Users</a></h3>
		<p>
			Without ever compromising your privacy, TPF anonymously tracks which feeds are most popular with users like you!  We use this information to ensure that we are consistently delivering the highest quality news and information from the sources that your prefer.  For example, if news outlet A and news outlet B both publish articles about topic X and TPF users view the news article from outlet A more than a similar article from outlet B, we will feature story X from company A more prominently.  More than that, we will start featuring all news stories from company A in a better position.  You, the average TPF user, continuously help to make our stream of news articles the highest quality.
